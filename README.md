Tic-Tac-Toe game from the official react.js tutorial (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Just run `npm start`, and then play a game of tic-tac-toe with yourself.

The app runs in the development mode, and is accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Extras

I attempted to complete all the "ideas for improvements" listed at the end of the tutorial:

1. Display the move location (col, row) in the move history list.
1. Bold the currently selected item in the move history list.
1. Use two loops to make the game board squares.
1. Add a toggle button for sorting the moves in ascending or descending order.
1. Highlight winning squares when a player wins.
1. Display a message when there's a draw.
